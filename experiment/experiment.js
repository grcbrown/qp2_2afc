            <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
            <p>You are invited to participate in a research study. Its general purpose is to understand how people perceive spoken language. We are interested in how people make use of varying properties of language to infer social information about a speaker. In this study, you will hear spoken sentences, and you will be asked to make simple decisions about the speaker of each sentence. Following this, you will be asked to complete an optional demographic survey. Participation in this research is voluntary, and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
            <h3>TIME INVOLVEMENT</h3> 
            <p>Your participation will take approximately 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
            <h3>PAYMENT</h3> 
            <p>You will be paid at the posted rate.</p>
            <h3>PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</h3> 
            <p>The risks associated with this study are minimal. This judgment is based on a large body of experience with the same or similar procedures with people of similar ages, sex, origins, etc. Study data will be stored securely, in compliance with Stanford University standards, minimizing the risk of confidentiality breach. Your individual privacy will be maintained during the research and in all published and written data resulting from the study.</p>
            <h3>CONTACT INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions, concerns or complaints about this research study, its procedures, risks and benefits, you should contact the Protocol Director, Grace Brown, at (616) 498-8188. If you are not satisfied with how this study is being conducted, or if you have any concerns, complaints, or general questions about the research or your rights as a participant, please contact the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB) to speak to someone independent of the research team at (650) 723-2480 or toll free at 1-866-680-2906. You can also write to the Stanford IRB, Stanford University, 1705 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA.</p>

        <p>In this study, you will listen to a series of different sentences produced by a variety of different speakers. In a given trial, you will hear an audio clip of a speaker producing a sentence. While this audio clip is playing, you will be prompted to select one of two labels that best describes the speaker. To select a response, you will press either the ‘D’ or ‘K’ key on your keyboard. There will be a reminder of what keys to press in each trial. Please try to respond as quickly as possible. If you do not respond within 10 seconds after the audio clip has played, the experiment will advance automatically.</p>
